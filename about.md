### About Me (The formal edition)

Hi there! I am Aditi, a final year Computer Science and Engineering undergraduate at [National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal](https://www.nitk.ac.in/). I am an incoming Software Engineer at Amazon India. I am currently interning as a Student Developer under [Google Summer of Code 2020](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) at [CERN-HSF](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6547073815543808). I previously interned as a Technology Analyst at Morgan Stanley, Bangalore in the summer of 2019.

### About Me (The informal edition)

Yo! Aditi here! I love quizzing (more like, it is the only non-technical thing I am decent at xP). SciBizTech, General, Astronomy, India and History are the genres I enjoy the most. (I really hope people at LSD, NITK read this and invite me to QM for once :P)

I look up at the sky more than often. It lights me up. I can name and identify (when they are above the horizon) all the stars in the Winter Hexagon without a hitch (thanks to my amazeball seniors at [Amateur Astronomy Club, NITK](https://aacnitk.wordpress.com/) :D).  A very dear friend of mine once hand-drew this (see below) Calvin & Hobbes comic for me, which has ever since, been pinned on my softboard. It is a constant reminder of the fact that   my petty everyday worries are nothing more than a microscopic blip in the universe.
